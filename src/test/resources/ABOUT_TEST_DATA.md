# MCA Palette Samples

### 1.20.4
* **biomes-1.20.4-r.0.0_X21Y-3Z3_6entries.snbt** -
  interesting because it highlights the need to compute bits per index from palette size and not from the
  number of longs - computing from number of longs gives the wrong answer because this sample overflows
  3 longs by as single record.
* **block_states-1.20.4-6entries.snbt** -
  interesting because only 3 bits are required to encode size 6 palette data, but it actually uses 4 bits.
* **block_states-1.20.4-14entries.snbt** -
  interesting because bit packing has no waste on the per-long level, 4 bits to encode size 14 palette data.
* **block_states-1.20.4-r.0.0_X6Y-3Z23_72entries.snbt** -
  interesting because it's the largest chunk section found in a random world's region file having a 
  bits per index of 7.

# Chunk Mover Samples

### single_start_record_with_all_xz_fields
A hand curated structure start (single record) that is defined for two chunk locations so one can be read,
moved to the location of the other, and validated with a simple equality check.

The POST_MOVE_CLIPPED file is the result of moving to chunk 0 0 which clips the structure on the r.0.0 region boundary.

The POST_MOVE_NOCLIP file is the result of moving to chunk 0 0 without a clipping region defined.
